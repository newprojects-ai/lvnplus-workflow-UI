# Workflow Management System - Development Log

## Latest Update: Comprehensive Workflow Canvas Redesign

### Issues Identified with Current Canvas:
1. **Connector System Problems:**
   - Connectors hang around after creation
   - No way to finish/complete connector creation
   - Connectors don't properly link to elements
   - No visual feedback during connection process

2. **Element Management Issues:**
   - Multiple start elements created on single click
   - Elements cannot be deleted individually
   - All elements move together instead of individually
   - No proper drag and drop implementation

3. **Visual Design Problems:**
   - Decision nodes use rectangles instead of diamond shapes
   - Poor visual hierarchy and feedback
   - Lack of proper connection points
   - No grid or alignment helpers

4. **Interaction Problems:**
   - Poor user experience with element manipulation
   - No context menus or proper selection states
   - Missing keyboard shortcuts and accessibility

### Improvements Implemented:

#### 1. **Enhanced Connector System:**
- Proper connection state management
- Visual feedback during connection creation
- Click-to-connect and drag-to-connect modes
- Connection validation and prevention of invalid connections
- Proper cleanup of temporary connections

#### 2. **Individual Element Management:**
- Fixed drag and drop for individual elements
